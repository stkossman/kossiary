## What is it "noob" theory?

The "noob" theory emerged from the Dota 2 community thanks to streamer and commentator Nix ([Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/nix)).
Or at least that's where I heard it. It describes a paradoxical situation where a player who does everything wrong
(the "anchor" of the team) eventually becomes useful nonetheless.

In the context of Dota 2:
- The enemy deals primarily magical damage
- You buy whe wrong items (physical resistance instead of magical)
- You lose fights and make poor decisions (even if player considered one of the best on the team)
- But eventually the situation changes, and "mistakes" become useful

## How it works in the game

### Early game phase

Poor item choices in early game. For example, you bought a _Crimson Guard_ (a team item that provides physical resistance).
However, you didn't buy a _Pipe of Insight_ (a team item that provides magical resistance) and lost early game advantage.

### Mid game transition

Despite poor decisions, the game continues. The team adapts to the situation:
- Other players compensate for your shortcomings
- Enemies develop in unexpected directions
- The game's objectives changes

### Late game phase

Suddenly your poor decisions on item choices become useful! What a surprise! You finally decided to buy a _Pipe of Insight_
against magical damage, congratulations! But now this item is now not as useful as it could be since you didn't realised your early game advantage 
because for almost same price you bought a _Crimson Guard_.
But in the end, _Crimson Guard_ is still useful. Funny, init?

Also funny things is that how you still did not lose game? You team still making good decisions, you still have chances to win despite the fact that made poor decisions.
You decided to play on a long term basis, to long the game as long as you can. In the end, you still win.

Sounds paradoxical. Why you decided to play on a long term basis, to long the game, when you could have just played on a short term basis, to short the game and win it quickly?

## Application to real life

### In work environments
This theory perfectly describes situations with "bad" employees:
- Inappropriate skills - a developer learns an unnecessary technology
- Poor decisions - a manager makes "bad" decisions
- Time lag - usefulness only manifests over time

### Example from an IT company
A developer insists on using a new, immature library instead of proven solutions. The team suffers for months, but:
- A year later, this library becomes an industry standard
- The team already has experience with it
- Other teams are just starting to learn this technology

So, initial sitation looks like this:
"Bad" developer suggests a new unproven library or framework etc. Team resists to use this technology and short term impact is negative.

After one year, the situation changes - technology becomes an industry standard. The team is now ready to use it and is already becoming so-called "experts". You now have a competitive advantage.

## Why does this work?

### The uncertainty principle
The future is always unpredictable. What seems like a mistake today may turn out to be a brilliant decision tomorrow.

### System adaptation
Teams and organizations adapt to "bad" developers:
- Other team members compensate for weaknesses
- The system finds a way to utilize even wrong actions
- Mistakes create space for unconventional solutions

## Conclusions
The "noob" theory doesn't justify poor choices but show the importance of:
1. Patience - give "bad" decisions time to manifest themselves
2. Adaptability - be prepared for chaning circumstances
3. Diversity - different approaches create system resilience

Sometimes the worst player on the team suddenly becomes the MVP at a crucial moment. Similarly, in life - today's
"noob" might become tomorrow's leader.

_I still will be working on this theory. It is not finished yet. Consider it as a draft. This theory still need lots of polishing and work since it can have some holes and inconsistencies.
This theory is not scientifically proven or smth, but its funny and offers interesting way of thinking
about team dynamics and uncertainty._
