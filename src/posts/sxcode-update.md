## Introduction

**SyntxCode** update! Here we go.
This release brings new languages support: Python, C# and C++.

That's all. Really, that's it. I just wanted to share the update with you.

## Plans about the future
I have some plans for the future of **SyntxCode**. Like adding more languages and themes.

However, I don't think this framework will be really useful without JavaScript since it takes lots of time
to highlight your code using lots of `<span>` elements. It is really slow and not efficient.
Frameworks like PrismJS or Highlight.js are much better for this purpose.

SyntxCode can be useful for small parts of code, but not for large ones for sure.
I am losing interest in this project, but I will keep it alive for now. 
I'll keep adding some more languages and themes, but I think not a lot.
