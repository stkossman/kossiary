## Introduction

I'm building a complete personal website from scratch using [Astro](https://astro.build/), and I want to document this journey as I go. This isn't just another portfolio siteâ€”it's a comprehensive platform that will showcase my projects, host my blog, and serve as a digital hub for everything I create.

## Why Build From Scratch?

**Learning Through Building**: I chose Astro specifically to dive deeper into modern web technologies. There's something powerful about understanding every line of code in your personal space on the web.

**Minimalist Philosophy**: I'm passionate about clean, content-focused design. My goal is to create something that feels effortless to navigate while being technically sophisticated under the hood.

**Professional Growth**: This project serves as both a learning exercise and a professional showcase. Every feature I implement becomes part of my development portfolio .

The inspiration came from [Theodorus Clarence](https://theodorusclarence.com/?ref=readme) and other developers who've created beautiful, functional personal sites. While there are countless portfolio templates available, building my own allows me to implement exactly what I need, nothing more.

## Today's Development Progress

### Home Page
So far, home page looks completed. I feel like there's nothing to add and edit more.
Now home page looks like:

- Full screen hero section with my name and "under construction" notice
- Small description section about me with GitHub, LinkedIn, and Resume links
- Featured projects section with a selection of projects I've worked on
- Learning section with technologies I study to expand my stack

### About page
The About page was already structured with the core sections that define a comprehensive personal introduction:

- Personal introduction sharing my background as a front-end engineer working with React and Astro ecosystems
- Bio section mentioning my native city and university I am currently studying at
- Tech stack section featuring interactive icons with tooltips showing my day-to-day favorite technologies
- Experience section documenting my well.. experience
- Uses section detailing both my workstation setup and applications

Today's refinements made:
- Removed photo and "what I'm up to now" section for cleaner layout
- Added VS Code to my applications list alongside WebStorm
- Implemented CSS fixes for tech icon tooltip arrow positioning

### Footer Enhancements
The Footer was already structured too yet what were added:

- Added "Archived Websites" section to showcase previous portfolios

### Development Workflow Improvements

- Changed to VS Code from Webstorm
- Configured VS Code auto-formatting with Prettier to automatically format code on save

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Astro, React, TailwindCSS, TypeScript
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Styling**: Minimalist approach with custom TailwindCSS configurations

## What's Next?

I'm considering several enhancements for upcoming development sessions:
- Enhanced project showcase with better filtering
- Dark mode implementation
- Perfomance optimizations and accessibility improvements

The repository will be public soon at [GitHub - andriistavskyi.dev](https://github.com/stkossman/andriistavskyi.dev), and I'll continue documenting each major milestone in this development journal series.
