## Introduction

I wanted to write a quick article about the future of my CSS frameworks. I have been working on [Soul of CSS](https://soul-of-css.vercel.app) for a while now and [SyntxCode](https://syntxcode.vercel.app).

## Quick Stats & Achievements

Let's talk about [**Soul of CSS**](https://github.com/stkossman/soul-of-css) - CSS component-based framework inspired by Souls like games.

So far, I have already done and achieved some stuff.
Quick stats:
- 2 stars on GitHub (yeah man)
- 8 versions with a sum of 400+ downloads
- 10 sets of components + 1 set of animations _(buttons, inputs, lists, containers, badges, etc.)_

Now [**SyntxCode**](https://github.com/stkossman/syntxcode) - CSS framework inspired by Prism.js and Highlight.js for highlighting code.
Quick stats:
- 4 versions with a sum of almost 300 downloads
- Support of 7 languages and 3 themes;
- No dependencies and any JS - **pure CSS**

Those frameworks are still in development, but I am really happy with the results.

## Future Development

Now about the future development of those frameworks.

For **Soul of CSS**, firstly, I plan to shape the framework to be more user-friendly and actually be useful and usable.
Change color, fonts, size, etc. I'll just reshape it till I love it and till I can't change it anymore.

For **SyntxCode**, I will add more languages and themes. Nonetheless, I can't promise I will update it more.
I understand pure CSS is not the best solution for highlighting code, but it was the main idea of the project - not to use JavaScript.

It is highly possible I will stop developing it after adding a few more languages. It is just not comfortable for users actually use it.
Maybe it is okay for small snippets, but not for big code blocks.

Look what it takes to highlight small code block using SyntxCode:
```css
<div class="sxcode is-css theme-light">
<pre><code>
<span class="tok-selector">h1</span> <span class="tok-punc">{</span>
  <span class="tok-property">color</span><span class="tok-punc">:</span> <span class="tok-value">red</span><span class="tok-punc">;</span>
  <span class="tok-property">margin</span><span class="tok-punc">:</span> <span class="tok-number">1rem</span><span class="tok-punc">;</span>
  <span class="tok-property">font-family</span><span class="tok-punc">:</span> <span class="tok-value">sans-serif</span><span class="tok-punc">;</span>
<span class="tok-punc">}</span>

<span class="tok-selector">.container</span> <span class="tok-punc">{</span>
  <span class="tok-property">max-width</span><span class="tok-punc">:</span> <span class="tok-number">1200px</span><span class="tok-punc">;</span>
  <span class="tok-property">margin</span><span class="tok-punc">:</span> <span class="tok-number">0</span> <span class="tok-value">auto</span><span class="tok-punc">;</span>
<span class="tok-punc">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
```
You see? It is not comfortable to highlight every symbol with .tok-* class. But it works.

I will be maintaining it for a while, but I don't think I will update it more.

## Why I am making frameworks?

I know there are tons of frameworks out there. I am not trying to replace them or compete with them.
I just want to make something I would like to use myself someday. 
Consider it as my side projects for practice and understating CSS/SCSS world more.

You know, I still have more ideas for CSS frameworks. It is _obsession_ already. But I like it anyway.
