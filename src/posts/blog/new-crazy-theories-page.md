## Expanding the Digital Mindspace

I am excited to announce a new addition to the blog - a dedicated section for **Crazy Theories**."
This is a space where I'll be sharing my most wild, unconventional ideas, thought experiments and other crazy stuff.

## What to Expect in This Section

- **Mandess Level Rating**: Each theory gets a 1-10 score based on its craziness.
- **Real-World Applications**: Even the craziest ideas will have some practical applications.

### The Topics
I'll be exploring theories about/from:
- Gaming mechanics and their life parallels
- Social behaivour patterns
- Professional development paradoxes
- And whatever else my speer-deprived brain conjures up

The section lives at [Crazy Theories](/theories). Feel free to check it out.
