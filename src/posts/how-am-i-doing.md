## University

Its been a while since I last wrote a blog post. Not a lot has happened in my life anyway :/

I took a break from my side projects and started studying more at the university. So far,
I am doing well. Especially the frontend part (_hehe_). I have separate subject for **React and Next.js**.
I am really enjoying it even though I know a lot of it already. Teacher is glad to see my
knowledge and how do I make things in React. He is even giving me a lot of feedback and extra marks.

My goals for React coursework are simple - to show off my skills of what I can do with React and Next.js.
I guess this is a good opportunity to get feedback from someone experienced in this field (_10+ years of experience_).

By the way, you can check my **React coursework** here: [React Homeworks](https://oa-react-homeworks.vercel.app)
Maybe, I'll add some more stuff to it. Like how many points I got from each homework etc. I am not sure yet :/

What about my other subjects?.. I am not sure about one - **OOP in C#**. Seems kinda hard to me. I am not really a
backend developer. But I will try my best anyway. Damn, it is already hard in the beginning - abstract concepts, interfaces, delegates... Hate it.

## Side Projects

Well, I am not really doing many side projects. I remember about my CSS frameworks. I will try to finish them and polish to ideality.
For now, I'll focus on studying overall. Especially backend part - **OOP in C#** and **REST.API using ASP.NET Core**.
There's every likelihood that I will create one more repository with my backend side projects. But for now, I am not sure.

## Blog

By the way, what does the new design look like? I am not sure. I am not a designer. I tried to make it look nice, minimalistic.
Sort of Cursor design. I'll keep it for now. Anyway, I can change it later if I feel like it.
