## Introduction

I've decided to remake my blog using [Astro](https://astro.build) (*yep, so fast after just creating it with next.js*), and I've hit a snag with pagination implementation (so funny..).
Despite this shit, I'm convinced Astro is the right choice - especially for content-focused sites like blogs.

Why Astro? Because I want! But here's some main reasons for me:

- **Fast Performance** (obviously Astro is faster than Nextjs for sites like blogs)
- **Framework Components** (i can use other JS frameworks components when needed)

## Main Content

### What I've already done

Well, everything. I've implemented everything: *home/about pages, posts components etc.* except for pagination between posts.
I'm miserable. I do not f*cking know why it is not working.
However, I will not give up :)

I tried to stick with structure just like I have in Next.js project. Guess it's right choice, but
for some reason I feel it is kinda *not right*.
