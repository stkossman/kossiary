## Introduction

Since I got into JavaScript and especially its frameworks, I’ve been guilty of one nasty habit: trying to force them into everything.
Every project, every idea, every little experiment — boom, I’d wrap it in React, Next, Astro or whatever.

At first, it felt powerful. Like I suddenly had this ultimate tool, and with it, I could build anything.
But here’s the truth: applying JS frameworks everywhere is not just overkill, it’s actually disgusting.
It goes against how IT really works, even for a front-end developer.

## The Problem

Frameworks are great. They solve real problems: complex state management, scalable UI, component reusability, routing, you name it.
They exist because web apps are complicated.

But when you start thinking in frameworks first, you stop thinking in problems and solutions.
You don’t ask: _what’s the best tool here?_ Instead, you ask: _how can I twist this into React or Next.js?_

I found myself in:
- Using React to build static one-pagers.
- Adding dependencies where plain CSS and HTML would be enough.
- Copy-pasting components boilerplate for things that didn't even need JavaScript.

That’s not engineering. That’s addiction.

## Why It's Wrong
IT isn’t about pushing one tool everywhere. It’s about choosing the right approach for the right problem.

Even as a front-end developer, you need to respect the whole stack.
Sometimes the solution lives in CSS. Sometimes in HTML semantics.
Sometimes in backend APIs or database design. JavaScript is just one piece of the puzzle.

## What I Learned

I had to step back and remind myself:
- **HTML is not obsolete**. Structure matters.
- **CSS is not optional**. Design and styling deserve first-class thinking.
- **Backend matters**. Data and architecture drive the app, not just the shiny UI.
- **Frameworks are tools, not laws or religions**. They should serve the project, not dictate it.

Frameworks are still powerful. I’ll keep using them. But now I try to ask myself: _does this project actually need it?_
If the answer is “no,” then I let JS stay where it belongs.

## Closing

Getting into JavaScript frameworks was a huge part of my IT journey.
But letting them take over my thinking was a mistake.
The more I learn, the more I realize that **real IT is about balance, not obsession**.

If you’re just starting out, don’t fall into the same trap.
Don’t try to solve every problem with the same shiny new library. Respect the whole toolkit.
You may even create your own framework some day, but _the last thing this world need is another shitty framework_.

Because at the end of the day, not everything should look like a component.

After all, this is my vision on my problem with JS frameworks. 
Maybe, it is now even a problem, and I am overthinking as hell.
