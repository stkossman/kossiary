## About the Project

### What is SyntxCode?

As I mentioned in my previous post, SyntxCode is a CSS framework designed to provide syntax highlighting for code snippets. It aims to be lightweight, easy to use, and customizable.

### Technical Details
Tech details stays the same. So check out the previous post for more information.

### Acknowledgements
This framework would not exist without inspiration from:
- [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com)
- [Highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org)

### What's Next?
I plan to continue improving the framework, adding more languages support and themes, and refining the documentation.

### Where to find it?
Finally I published it on [Github](https://github.com/stkossman/syntxcode) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/syntxcode)
