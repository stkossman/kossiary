## Introduction

So, I'm expanding my idea of creating a blog using [Astro](https://astro.build/). However, I've decided to create a whole new website.
It will contain all my projects, blog posts, and other stuff.

## Why?

Firstly, I want to learn more about Astro itself, and I'd already decided some time ago to create smth in Astro.
Secondly, I want to create a website that will be more professional and more modern with a minimalistic(!) design.
I really fancy minimalistic design overall, and I think that this is the best way to create a website.

This idea came from [Theodorus Clarence](https://github.com/theodorusclarence) and his website [theodorusclarence.com](https://theodorusclarence.com/?ref=readme).
I know there are a lot of other websites that are similar and have the same idea, a lot more features, and more.
However, I want to create something similar yet simple myself. It will be becoming more and more complex over time since
I will be adding more and more features. Yet I want to keep it as simple and minimalistic as I can.

## What's next?

I've already started working on the website, and so far I will be posting updates here.
It has also already repo, but it is private for now _(hehe)_. Btw, it will be here [GitHub - andriistavkyi.dev](https://github.com/stkossman/andriistavskyi.dev).
And will be published soon. So, stay tuned.

I am planning to add moreeeee stuff, like a database for blog posts and notes, and more.
