## The Problem

Working on Astro projects, I kept running into messy relative import statements that made my components harder to read and maintain. Instead of clean imports, I was dealing with paths like:
```js
import MainLayout from "../../layout/MainLayout.astro";
import TechIcon from "../../components/react/TechIcon.jsx";
import { techStack } from "../../lib/techData.js";
```
This becomes particularly painful when you need to move files around or when working in deeply nested directory structures.

## The Solution: Absolute Imports
Astro supports absolute imports through TypeScript's path mapping feature, allowing you to create shortcuts for your imports. The configuration is straightforward and dramatically improves code readability.

### Configuration
In your tsconfig.json file, add the paths configuration under compilerOptions:
```json
{
"compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
        "@/*": ["src/*"],
        "@/components/*": ["src/components/*"],
        "@/layout/*": ["src/layout/*"],
        "@/pages/*": ["src/pages/*"],
        "@/styles/*": ["src/styles/*"],
        "@/lib/*": ["src/lib/*"],
        }
    }
}
```

### Clean Import Statements
After configuration, those messy relative imports become clean and descriptive:
```js
import MainLayout from "@/layout/MainLayout.astro";
import TechIcon from "@/components/react/TechIcon.jsx";
import { techStack } from "@/lib/techData.js";
```

## Universal Approach
While I'm demonstrating this with **Astro**, absolute imports are not framework-specific. This same tsconfig.json configuration works across any JavaScript or TypeScript project, whether you're using React, Next.js, Vue, Angular, or even plain Node.js applications. The path mapping feature is built into TypeScript itself, making it a universal solution for cleaner imports regardless of your tech stack. This means once you learn this pattern, you can apply it consistently across all your projects.
