## Introduction

**Soul of CSS** latest update - new table component. I tried to keep it simple while keeping Souls-like design.

## What's New?

### `soc-table` Table Component
I added a new component called `soc-table`, which is a simple and elegant table with additional classes.

- `is-hoverable` animation. 
```html
<table class="soc-table is-hoverable"></table>
```

- `is-striped` for striped rows.
```html
<table class="soc-table is-striped"></table>
```

- `is-centered` & `is-right` for text alignment.
```html
<table class="soc-table is-centered"></table>
<table class="soc-table is-right"></table>
```
