## Introduction

Well... I am working on another CSS framework but this time it can be actually useful. 
It is **SyntxCode** which helps to highlight code in `<code>` tags without any JS.

## About the Project

### What is SyntxCode?

**SyntxCode** is another CSS framework designed to provide a simple and effective way to style code snippets in HTML documents. 
And it is actually happening without any JavaScript.

### Technical Details
For now it supports only a few languages and a few themes, but I plan to add more in the future (especially themes).
- **Languages Supported**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby;
- **Themes**: Light, Dark and Github Dark.

**Some screenshots**

### Why Another CSS Framework?
I just want to make something what will people actually use and it can be useful for many people.

### Acknowledgements
This framework would not exist without inspiration from:
- [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com)
- [Highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org)

### What's Next?
I plan to continue improving the framework, adding more languages support and themes, and refining the documentation.

### Where to find it?
Nowhere for now, but I will publish it on Github and npm soon when I finish the first version and docs page.

It'll be available on [Github](https://github.com/stkossman/syntxcode) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/syntxcode) but now it is not published yet.
