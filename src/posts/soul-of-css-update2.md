## Introduction

**Soul of CSS** update! Here we go.
This release brings new element, new color and updated docs page (I will be updating it still).

---

## What's New?

### New Element & Color

- **Progress Bar** element. A new component for stylized progress bars.

- **New Border Color** for containers. I decided to change border color to darker one.
```scss
$color-border: #4a4a4a;
```
Here's how it looks now.

### Updated Docs Page

I updated the docs page with new styles and elements. Guess now it looks better (at least I hope).
